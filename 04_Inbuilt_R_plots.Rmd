## Preamble

Summarizing data through the use of descriptive statistics is greatly enhanced by visualizing the data.  Plots, figures, and graphs provide for rich insight into the knowledge hidden in the data.  Specific graphs are tailored to specific variable types and it is important to consider this.

The base R language can create a great number of plots.  These can be modified to create publication ready figures.  In this chapter we will look at some of the most commonly used plots.

There is also a rich set of libraries available that expand on the creation of graphs.  It is well worthwhile to explore these on your own.  They include the ubiquitous `ggplot2` and the interactive `plotly` libraries.

## Data import

We are going to use the `readr` and `dplyr` libraries in this chapter.

```{r Library import, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

Below, we import the now familiar `ProjectData.csv` file.  We will use the data in this spreadsheet to create our plots.

```{r Importing the ProjectData spreadsheet file, message=FALSE}
df <- read_csv("ProjectData.csv")
```

Just as a reminder, we explore the variables in our dataset using the `names()` function.  Pay particular attention to the data types as we decide which plots to visualize the data with.

```{r Variables}
names(df)
```

## Strip plots

Strip plots are also called dot plots.  We will use strip plots to introduce the way in which plots are created in R.  They represent data point values for a variable along a single axis.  It is more common for these plots to visualize discrete numerical variables, but they can also be used for continuous numerical variables and for nominal categorical variable that are expressed as numerical values.  The latter is better represented by bar plots, though.

Below, we create a strip plot to visualize the `Age` variable as an example of discrete data (since we only captured integer values).

```{r Strip plot of age}
stripchart(df$Age)
```

Our first impression is that this is not a very useful plot.  We have $500$ data point values and they all seem to be plotted on top of each other.  There is also no title and no _x_-axis label.  Let's start by adding some jitter to the dots to try and visualize all of them.  If there are a large number of data point values, this might not solve the problem.

```{r Strip plot with jitter}
stripchart(df$Age,
           method = "jitter")
```
 This is slightly better, but to be honest, a box-and-whisker plot would probably be the default plot for numerical data such as this.  Let's carry on, though, and add a title and a _x_-axis title with the `main =` and the `xlab =` arguments.
 
```{r Strip plot with titles}
stripchart(df$Age,
           method = "jitter",
           main = "Age of patient cohort",
           xlab = "Ages (in years)")
```
 
The `method = "stack"` argument creates nice _skyscrapers_ instead of the jitter used above.  This might be a better option.  Let's see.

```{r Strip plot with the stack option}
stripchart(df$Age,
           method = "stack",
           main = "Age of patient cohort",
           xlab = "Ages (in years)")
```
In essence this is very much a bar plot, though, so let's take a look.

## Bar plot

Bar plots give an indication of the number of individual data point values from the sample space of a variable.  As such they are excellent for categorical variables, but can also be used for discrete numerical variables.  Since both categorical variables and discrete numerical values are well, _discrete_, the bars have gaps between them to indicate that each of the items in the sample space for the variable is distinct from another.  They do not form a continuum as in continuous numerical variables.

The height of each bar indicates the number of times an element from the sample space of a variable appears in the data.  There are a number of options for bar plots.  Let's take a look at these and also introduce some new options for plots in R.

### Simple bar plot

A simple bar plot shows vertical bars, representing the count of each unique sample space element for the discrete variable.

```{r Simple bar plot}
barplot(table(df$Group),
        main = "Number of patients in each group",
        xlab = "Group",
        ylab = "Count",
        las = 1)  # Turns the y-axis values upright
```

### Horizontal bar plot

By setting the `horiz =' keyword argument to `TRUE`, we get horizontal bars

```{r Horizontal bar plot}
barplot(table(df$Survey),
        main = "Survey question",
        ylab = "Survey question answers",
        xlab = "Count",
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1)
```

We captured the ordinal categorical variable data point values for `Survey` as the numerical values $1,2,3,4$, and $5$.  In fact, they represent the sample space values: _Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither, Agree_, and _Strongly agree_.  We can add the using the `names.arg =` keyword argument.

```{r Bar plot with labels}
barplot(table(df$Survey),
        main = "Survey question",
        xlab = "Survey question answers",
        ylab = "Count",
        names.arg = c("Strongly disagree",
                      "Disagree",
                      "Neither",
                      "Agree",
                      "Strongly agree"),
        las = 1)
```

### Patterned bar plot

Instead of a solid color, we can add a fine pattern to fill the bars.  Below, we stipulate the border color for the bars, use grey as the fill color, and set a pattern with a low density.

```{r Patterned horizontal bar plot}
barplot(table(df$Survey),
        main = "Survey question",
        ylab = "Survey question answers",
        xlab = "Count",
        horiz = TRUE,
        border = "black",
        col = "grey",
        density = 20,
        las = 1)
```

### Colored bar plot

Although most journals require monochrome figures, R does not limit our ability to add color.  Below, we specify the color of each of the five bars.  Many colors in R have specific names, most of which are as we would expect.


```{r Colored bar plot}
barplot(table(df$Survey),
        main = "Survey question",
        ylab = "Survey question answers",
        xlab = "Count",
        horiz = TRUE,
        border = "black",
        col = c("red", "grey", "grey", "grey", "grey"),
        density = 20,
        las = 1)
```

A common form of bar charts is the stacked bar chart.  We can use it to show the counts of a discrete variable for more than one categorical group.

```{r Stacked bar plot}
barplot(table(df$Group, df$Survey),
        main = "Survey question per group",
        xlab = "Survey question answers",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        col = c("black", "grey"),
        legend = rownames(table(df$Group, df$Survey)),
        density = 20,
        las = 1)
```

### Grouped bar plot

For those that find stacked charts a bit uninformative (which can happen when the counts are very close), we can group the bars.

```{r Patterned bar plot in groups}
barplot(table(df$Group,
              df$Survey),
        main = "Survey question per group",
        xlab = "Survey question answers",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        col = c("black", "grey"),
        legend = rownames(table(df$Group, df$Survey)),
        density = c(20, 40),
        beside = TRUE,
        las = 1)
```

## Histogram

The histogram gives a count of the number of times a value, from a continuous numerical variable, appears.  Since these variables are continuous, though, we have to create _bins_, i.e. lower and upper bounds between which the occurrences are counted.  Let's take a look at an example to make this clear.  We use the `hist()` function to accomplish this.

```{r Histogram of patient age with density pattern}
hist(df$Age,
     main = "Histogram of patient ages",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Count",
     density = 10,  # Density pattern
     las = 1)
```

It seem as if the default plot created bins in five year intervals so that we ended up with $10$ bins.  We can use the `break =` argument to change this behavior.  The value that we pass to this argument will determine the number of bins.

```{r Histogram of ages with five bins}
hist(df$Age,
     breaks = 5,
     main = "Histogram of patient ages",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Count",
     las = 1)
```

Five breaks we formed allowing for the creation of six bins.

We can add a count to each bar with the `labels = TRUE` argument.  Sometimes the top of the numbers are cut off.  The alleviate this problem, we create a bit more space by increasing the $y$ axis range.  Below the `ylim = ` keyword argument is set to `0` to `90`.

```{r Histogram with labels}
hist(df$Age,
     labels = TRUE,  # Adding labels
     main = "Histogram of patient ages",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Count",
     ylim = c(0, 90),
     las = 1)
```

Now we have $10$ year bins.  We can actually pass a vector of values to determine the bins.  We include the minimum and maximum values to show the outer bounds.  Note that we need not create bins of equal size.

```{r Histogram with specified bin boundaries}
hist(df$Age,
     breaks = c(min(df$Age),50, 70, 80, max(df$Age)),
     main = "Histogram of patient ages",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Relative frequency")
```

Under these circumstances, we no longer have a count, but rather a relative frequency (fractional count).  This can also be forced with the `freq = FALSE` argument.

You may wonder in which bins the border cases are included.  In the plot above, for example, we need to know if a patient who is $40$ years of age is counted in the left-most bin or in the larger (broader) bin.  By default, the inclusion is on the minimum border.   Therefor this patient will be counted in the broader bin.  The `right = TRUE` argument changes this behavior to the upper bound value.

```{r Histogram for more than one group}
transparent_dark_grey = rgb(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5)  # Specifying the RGBA values for the color
transparent_light_grey = rgb(0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.5)
hist((df %>% filter(Group == "I") %>% select(Age))$Age,
     col = transparent_dark_grey,
     main = "Age distribution  for each group",
     xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "Count")
hist((df %>% filter(Group == "II") %>% select(Age))$Age,
     col = transparent_light_grey,
     add = TRUE)
legend("topright",
       legend = c("Group I", "Group II"),
       col = c(transparent_dark_grey, transparent_light_grey),
       pt.cex = 2,
       pch = 15)
```

## Density plots

A density plot creates a mathematical formula to _smooth out_ the histogram.  It is a great visual aid to look at the shape of the distribution of the data point values.  below, we note that our patient ages as only somewhat normally distributed.

```{r A simple density plot}
plot(density(df$Age),
     main = "Distribution of patient ages",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Density",
     lwd = 2)
```

## Box and whisker plots

These are the most common plots used to show the distribution of numerical variables for one or more categorical or discrete groups.  In the code chunk below, we look at the age distribution of each of the two groups.

```{r Box plot of ages per group}
boxplot(df$Age ~ df$Group,
        col = c(transparent_dark_grey, transparent_light_grey),
        boxwex = 0.4,  # Width of boxes as a fraction
        main = "Age per group",
        xlab = "Group",
        ylab = "Age")
legend("topright",
       legend = c("Group I", "Group II"),
       col = c(transparent_dark_grey, transparent_light_grey),
       pt.cex = 2,
       pch = 15)
```

The dark middle bar indicates the value of the median (or second quartile).  The upper and lower edges of the boxes are the values for the third and first quartiles.  If there are no statistical outliers, the whiskers stretch out to the maximum (top) and minimum (bottom) values.  Values that are more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range more than the third quartile or less than the first quartile will be indicated as separate dots beyond the whiskers.  The latter will then be indicative of this limit of _outliers_.

## Scatter plots

Scatter plots are used to show the correlation between two numerical variables for each subject in a dataset.  Each dot is represents the value of one of the variables on the $x$ axis and the other variable on the $y$ axis.

```{r Age vs weight}
plot(df$Age, # Independent variable (x-axis)
     df$Weight,  # Dependent variable (y-axis)
     main = "Patient age vs weight",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Weight (in lbs)")
```

In the chapter on correlation and linear models, we will learn how to draw a line as a model for our data.  We add this with the `abline()` function below.  It is the `lm()` function used as an argument that does the actual calculation.  More on this in the mentioned, upcoming chapter.


```{r Adding a regression line}
plot(df$Age, # Independent variable (x-axis)
     df$Weight,  # Dependent variable (y-axis)
     main = "Patient age vs weight",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Weight (in lbs)")
abline(lm(df$Weight ~ df$Age))
```

There are a great number of arguments that we can use to control the look of a plot.  have a look at the code comments in the plot below to get a glimpse at the power of plotting in R.

```{r Controlling the axes}
plot(df$Age, # Independent variable (x-axis)
     df$Weight,  # Dependent variable (y-axis)
     main = "Patient age vs weight",
     xlab = "Age (in years)",
     ylab = "Weight (in lbs)",
     axes = FALSE)
# x-axis
# Small tick labels
par(tcl = 0.1)  # Tick length of +0.1 (protruding into plot)
axis(1,
     at = seq(30, 90, by = 1),  # From 30 to 90, stepsize 1
     labels = FALSE)  # Don't add number labels
# Slightly taller tick marks every 5 steps
par(tcl = 0.2)
axis(1,
     at = seq(30, 90, by = 5),
     labels = FALSE)
# MAjor tick marks every 10 years
par(tcl = -0.5)
axis(1,
     at = seq(30, 90, by = 10))
# y-axis
# Small tick marks every 1 lb
par(tcl = 0.1)
axis(2,
     at = seq(110, 230, by = 2),
     labels = FALSE)
par(tcl = -0.5)
axis(2,
     at = seq(110, 230, by = 20))
```

## Multiple plots

At times it makes sense to create more than one plot in a figure.  R allows for fine control over placement of different plot.

In the code below, we use a single row with two columns for our layout.  We plot both a bar plot and a pie plot of the same data.

A quick note on pie plots:  Pie plots are not good at providing accurate visual information, and hence, were not even discussed in this tutorial.  Even the help section states the following: _Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data._

```{r Combining two plots in a row}
grey_five <- c(rgb(0.1, 0.1, 0.1),
            rgb(0.3, 0.3, 0.3),
            rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
            rgb(0.7, 0.7, 0.7),
            rgb(0.9, 0.9, 0.9))  # Specifying five shades of grey
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # One row, two columns
barplot(table(df$Survey),
        main = "Bar plots",
        col = grey_five)
pie(table(df$Survey), 
    main = "Pie plots are bad",
    radius = 1,
    col = grey_five)
```

The graphical parameter `par(fig =)` lets us control the location of a figure precisely in a plot.

We need to provide the coordinates in a normalized form, i.e. as `c(x1, x2, y1, y2)`. For example, the whole plot area would be `c(0, 1, 0, 1)` with `(x1, y1) = (0, 0)` being the lower-left corner and `(x2, y2) = (1, 1)` being the upper-right corner.

Note: we have used parameters `cex` to decrease the size of labels and `mai` to define margins.

```{r Specifying exact positions}
# make labels and margins smaller
par(cex = 0.7, mai = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1))
# define area for the histogram
par(fig = c(0.1, 0.7, 0.3, 0.9))
hist(df$Age,
     main = "Three plots of patient age")
# define area for the boxplot
par(fig = c(0.8 ,1 ,0 ,1 ),
    new = TRUE)
boxplot(df$Age)
# define area for the stripchart
par(fig = c(0.1, 0.67, 0.1, 0.25),
    new = TRUE)
stripchart(df$Age,
           method = "jitter")
```

## Saving plots for your reports

Most manuscripts include plots as figures.  Plots created in R can be saved to your computer drive.  Below we use the `png()` function to save portable network graphics files.  This is a common file type for pictures, with a small file size and good quality.

The `png()` function allows us to specify a picture size (width and height).  The default unit is pixels.  R also provides for saving in other file types.  Look up `bmp`, `jpeg`, and `tiff` in the _Help_ tab on the bottom right panel in RStudio.

Once the code for saving the file is complete, remember to use the `dev.off()` function.

```{r Saving a file}
png(file = "Fig 1.png",  # Directory or folder set by setwd(getwd())
    width = 600,
    height = 600)
set.seed(1234)
boxplot(rchisq(100, df = 2),
               col = "gold",
        boxwex = 0.4,
        main = "c-Reactive Protein",
        ylab = "CRP")
dev.off()  # Search for dev.off in the Help tab
```

## Conclusion

Whole textbooks can be written on plotting in R.  It is best to explore all the plots that are available.  Fortunately, there is a lot of information in the Help section in RStudio.  Frequently consult this section to learn more about all the different arguments that can be used to modify your plots.

Plots tell a visual story and help us understand our data.  Use them liberally in your data analysis.
