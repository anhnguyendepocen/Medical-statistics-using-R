# Medical-statistics-using-R
This repository contains the RMD files and other resources for my _on-campus_ course on __medical statistics using the R language for statistical analysis__.
The course takes place in the Division of General Surgery Seminar Room, on J-floor in the Old Main Building of Groote Schuur Hospital.  Tutorials start at 17H00 every Tuesday and Thursday evenings, the latter being a repeat of the Tuesday tutorial for those that cannot attend the first session.
